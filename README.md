# C-Printf collaborative project
The _printf() function is used to generate formatted output. It sends the output to the standard output stream (stdout). Upon successful execution, the function returns the count of characters printed. If the function encounters an error, it returns -1.

The following conversion specifiers are available for formatting:

%c: Prints a single character. 

%s: Prints a sequence of characters as a string. 

%d: Prints integers. %i: Prints integers. 

%b: Prints the binary representation of an unsigned decimal number. 

%u: Prints unsigned integers. 

%x: Prints the hexadecimal representation of an unsigned decimal number using lowercase letters. 

%X: Prints the hexadecimal representation of an unsigned decimal number using uppercase letters. 

%r: Prints a reversed string. %R: Prints the Rot13 interpretation of a string.
